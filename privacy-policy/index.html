    This SatSigner Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices that are applicable to your use of the SatSigner mobile application (the "App").
    <br><br>
    <b>1. Privacy Practices</b>
    <br>
    SatSigner is designed to be used in a decentralized, privacy-focused manner. We do not collect, use, maintain, or share any personal information about you when you use the App. We do not use any tracking technology to track your use of the App, nor do we allow third parties to collect personal information about you or track your use of the App.
    <br>
    No aggregated data or basic usage events for analytics and application crashes are collected. Any information that you provide to us when you communicate with our technical support will only be used for purposes of addressing your specific support request.
    <br>
    All sensitive data, including private keys and transaction information, is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this information.
    <br>
    IP addresses, transaction, and price data may be collected when accessing optional remote services (such as mempool.space, Electrs, or Explora servers). Connect to your own node to mitigate the risk of data collection.

    <br><br>
    <b>2. Third Party App Stores</b>
    <br>
    If you purchase or access the App through a third party app store, such as the App Store or Google Play (an "App Store"), you will have a separate, additional account relationship with that App Store. The information you provide to that App Store will be handled in accordance with the privacy practices of the applicable App Store. App Stores are not partners or representatives of SatSigner, and we are not responsible for the acts or omissions of an App Store with regard to the collection, use, maintenance, or disclosure of your information.

    <br><br>
    <b>3. No Use by Children</b><br>
    The App is not intended for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of thirteen (13), please do not use the App.

    <br><br>
    <b>4. Modifications to this Privacy Notice</b><br>
    We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Notice by posting the modified privacy notice on the App at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue your use of the App prior to the time the modified privacy notice takes effect. If you continue using the App after the modified privacy notice takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy notice.

    <br><br>
    <b>5. How to Contact Us</b><br>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, please contact us at p@pedromvpg.com.
